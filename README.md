# Data
Data collection, cleaning and imputation for Honours project

## Scripts
- First preference, two party preferred and two candidate preferred vote scripts are in the AEC folder.
- Census scripts are in the ABS folder. Two levels of aggregation: Commonwealth Electoral Divisions (CED) and Postal Areas (POA).
- Imputation (both CED and POA) scripts are in the Imputation folder. First step is "mapping" and second is "interpolate". [Note that the original CED imputation RMD may be difficult to follow - better to look at the POA imputation "mapping-POA.R" - code will be cleaned up close to the end of 2018].

## Raw files
Raw files have not been included this repo. Scripts/Rmarkdown files to download, unzip and wrangle data provide all the necessary instructions and code. Please ensure that you adjust the directories in the files appropriately.
